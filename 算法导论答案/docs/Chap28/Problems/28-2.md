> A pratical method for interpolating a set of points with a curve is to use **cubic splines**. We are given a set $\\{(x_i, y_i): i = 0, 1, \ldots, n\\}$ of $n + 1$ point-value pairs, where $x_0 < x_1 < \cdots < x_n$. We wish to fit a piecewise-cubic curve (spline) $f(x)$ to the points. That is, the curve $f(x)$ is made up of $n$ cubic polynomials $f_i(x) = a_i + b_ix + c_ix^2 + d_ix^3$ for $i = 0, 1, \ldots, n - 1$, where if $x$ falls in the range $x_i \le x \le x_{i + 1}$, then the value of the curve is given by $f(x) = f_i(x - x_i)$. The points $x_i$ at which the cubic polynomials are "pasted" together are called **knots**. For simplicity, we shall assume that $x_i = i$ for $i = 0, 1, \ldots, n$.

Express each coefficient $a_i$, $b_i$, $c_i$ and $d_i$ in terms of the values $y_i$, $y_{i + 1}$, $D_i$, and $D_{i + 1}$. (Remember that $x_i = i$.) How quickly can we compute the $4n$ coefficients from the point-value pairs and first derivatives?
