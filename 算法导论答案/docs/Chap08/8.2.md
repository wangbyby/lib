## 8.2-1

> Using Figure 8.2 as a model, illustrate the operation of $\text{COUNTING-SORT}$ on the array $A = \langle 6, 0, 2, 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 1, 3, 2 \rangle$.

We have that $C = \langle 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 9, 11 \rangle$. Then, after successive iterations of the loop on lines 10-12, we have

\begin{align}
B & = \langle, , , , , 2, , , , , \rangle, \\\\
B & = \langle, , , , , 2, , 3, , , \rangle, \\\\
B & = \langle, , , 1, , 2, , 3, , , \rangle
\end{align}

and at the end,

$$B = \langle 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 6, 6 \rangle.$$

## 8.2-2

> Prove that $\text{COUNTING-SORT}$ is stable.

Consider two elements in the input array, $A[s]$ and $A[s + 1]$, such that $A[s] = A[s + 1]$, $1 \le s \le n - 1$.

After the execution of the final fo $r$ loop in $\text{COUNTING-SORT}$, $B[p] = A[s + 1]$ and $B[p - 1] = A[s]$, $2 \le p \le n$. $A[s]$ and $A[s + 1]$ appear in the output array $B$ in the same order as they appear in $A$. Therefore, $\text{COUNTING-SORT}$ is stable.

*[The following solution also answers Exercise 8.2-2.]*

Notice that the correctness argument in the text does not depend on the order in which $A$ is processed. The algorithm is correct no matter what order is used!

But the modified algorithm is not stable. As before, in the final **for** loop an element equal to one taken from $A$ earlier is placed before the earlier one (i.e., at a lower index position) in the output array $B$. The original algorithm was stable because an element taken from $A$ later started out with a lower index than one taken earlier. But in the modified algorithm, an element taken from $A$ later started out with a higher index than one taken earlier.

In particular, the algorithm still places the elements with value $k$ in positions $C[k - 1] + 1$ through $C[k]$, but in the reverse order of their appearance in $A$.

## 8.2-4

> Describe an algorithm that, given n integers in the range $0$ to $k$, preprocesses its input and then answers any query about how many of the $n$ integers fall into a range $[a..b]$ in $O(1)$ time. Your algorithm should use $\Theta(n + k)$ preprocessing time.

Compute the $C$ array as is done in counting sort. The number of integers in the range $[a..b]$ is $C[b] - C[a - 1]$, where we interpret $C[-1]$ as $0$.
