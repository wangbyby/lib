# Solutions to **Introduction to Algorithms** *Third Edition*

## Getting Started

This [website](https://walkccc.github.io/CLRS/) contains nearly complete solutions to the bible textbook - [**Introduction to Algorithms** *Third Edition*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition) published by [Thomas H. Cormen](https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/thomas-h-cormen), [Charles E. Leiserson](https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/charles-e-leiserson), [Ronald L. Rivest](https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/ronald-l-rivest) and [Clifford Stein](https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/clifford-stein).

Hope to reorganize solutions to help more people and myself study algorithms. By using [Markdown (.md)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files, it's much more readable on portable devices now.

Please don't hesitate to give me your feedback if any adjustment is needed with the sorted solutions. You can simply press the "Pencil icon" in the upper right corner to edit the contents or simply [open an issue](https://github.com/walkccc/CLRS/issues/new) in [my repository](https://github.com/walkccc/CLRS/).

## Working on following exercises

[18.2-1](https://walkccc.github.io/CLRS/Chap18/18.2/#182-1), [19.2-1](https://walkccc.github.io/CLRS/Chap19/19.2/#192-1).

I will continue to complete VII Selected Topics.

## How I generate this website

I use the static site generator [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) and the beautiful theme [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) to build this website!

Since there are some LaTeX equations [KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/) doesn't support, here I use [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) to render the math equations in my website.

I also add [overflow-x: auto](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_overflow-x.asp) to prevent the overflow issue on mobile devices, so you can scroll horizontally in the math display equations.
